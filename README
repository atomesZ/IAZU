To run it locally:

cd src

docker-compose up --build

then connect to localhost

you can use tunneling to make it available on the web as a POC (instead of reverse proxy nginx):

    ngrok http 80



To run it in the cloud:

cd src

# build and push container to registry
./build_and_push.sh

then in docker container instance, create an instance with env variables:


SUB_KEY = "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
LOCATION = "cloud"






OLD:

load the luis server:
    API_KEY="xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx" ./load_container.sh


cd src

install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

load our service:
    python3 server.py
